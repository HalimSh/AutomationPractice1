# AutomationPractice1

For the Sparta Global Registration Form. 

POM file has been set up which contains all
the example tests. 

Homepage contains all the methods for getting to
the Homepage and checking the field String.

A Field package has been created containing all
the possible fields for testing. 

2 tests are added:
1) Regex tester for the field to check the value
is accurate. 
2) An input tester to check the correct input
can be sent via keys. 

The user can add further tests to the framework 
to check the websites usability.
